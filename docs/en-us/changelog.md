#### Important changes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installer version: The installation type has been changed to Per-User.

The installation type has been changed to per-user, and administrator privileges are no longer required for installation.   
The previous per-machine installation cannot coexist and must be uninstalled first. If an older version is already installed, a dialog box prompting you to uninstall will be displayed and the installation process will be aborted. User data will remain even after uninstallation, so it will be carried over, but we recommend backing it up by exporting it just in case.  
Context menu registration to Explorer is done in the settings window, just like the ZIP version.
